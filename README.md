A Blender add-on made by an animation video enthusiast for Blender. Main features: MMD lip-sync generation (planned expansion), MMD blinking generation, and other functions.

Will be renamed to: half_bottled_blender_plugin, with planned optimization and iteration of related functions.

Originally: the whisky_helper_for_blender plugin, primarily used for generating lip-sync keyframes for MMD models.

Actually, it's just a small tool I made for myself when creating MMD videos. It may include some features I commonly use, but I may not continue developing or maintaining it.

## Features

### MMD Lip-Sync Generation

Recognizes phoneme mouth shapes through the Vosk audio model and applies them to MMD standard models.

MMD model mouth shape morph keys recognized by this plugin: あ, い, う, え, お, ん. All except あ will be mapped to あ if they don't exist, and an error will occur if あ doesn't exist.

Warning: This function will overwrite the morph keyframes for あ, い, う, え, お, ん within the audio time range.

#### Usage

![lips_gen2.0f.webp](.img/lips_gen2.0f.webp)

1. Select an audio file in Audio Path (most common audio formats are likely to work, including mp4)
2. Select any parent level of an MMD model (note: if there are multiple meshes under the object containing these morph keys, all mesh morph keys will be modified)
3. It is recommended to open the system console to observe progress. Mac Blender does not have this feature. (Blender menu bar -> windows -> Toggle System Console)
4. Set parameters and click Generate (~~note that the current version will generate some readable cache files in the same directory as the audio file, which will not be cleared~~)
5. Wait for the mouse pointer to change from a number back to normal

#### Parameter Introduction

![lips3.0.webp](.img/lips3.0.webp)

- Start Frame: Which frame the audio starts from
- DB Threshold: DB noise reduction, increase if recognition is inaccurate, decrease if not recognized
- RMS Threshold: RMS noise reduction, increase if recognition is inaccurate, decrease if not recognized
- Delayed Opening: Delayed mouth opening ratio
- Speed Up Opening: Curve speed adjustment parameter from recognition start to delayed mouth opening
- Max Morph Value: Maximum threshold for morph keys

#### How to Adapt to Other Models

For example, with VRM, you need to find or set up A, E, I, O, U, N morph keys for your model, and copy and change them to MMD standard morph key names.

**At least あ is required to use this function**

- あ = A
- い = I
- う = U
- え = E
- お = O
- ん = N

If you don't know how to copy, refer to: [copy_shape_key.md](docs/copy_shape_key.md)

### Random Blinking

Random blinking recognizes the まばたき morph key. If it doesn't exist, you need to convert or create this morph key yourself.

Warning: This function will overwrite the まばたき morph keyframes within the frame range.

1. Select any parent level of an MMD model (note: if there are multiple meshes under the object containing these morph keys, all mesh morph keys will be modified)
2. It is recommended to open the system console to observe progress. (Blender menu bar -> windows -> Toggle System Console)
3. Set parameters and click Generate
4. Wait for the mouse pointer to change from a number back to normal

![blink_args.webp](.img/blink_args.webp)

- blink interval: Blinking interval, unit seconds
- blinking wave ratio: Random ratio adjustable from 0.01-1
